## Update 04/09/2021
This project is no longer a primary focus of mine. I am practicing using using VS Code and pushing changes through the command line in Linux. Therefore this project will have a lot of commits and messy documentation until I get things ironed out. 
## Project Information
**This webpage will display information about one of my favorite bands, VOLA.**

This started as a simple practice for creating my index.html page and linking a styles.css file. 
I then decided to continuously add on as I progressed through the Thinkful prep course and let this be my first ever project. 
The current objective of this project is to create my first web page from scratch. It should incorporate everything learned in the HTML and CSS modules of the course.
