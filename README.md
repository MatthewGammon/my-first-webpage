# my-first-webpage

This started as a simple practice for creating my index.html page and linking a styles.css file. 
I then decided to continuously add on as I progressed through the Thinkful prep course. 

The current objective of this project is to create my first web page from scratch. It should incorporate everything learned in the HTML and CSS modules of the Thinkful prep course. 

This webpage will display information about one of my favorite bands, VOLA.
