# html-css-from-scratch

This started as a simple practice for creating my index.html page and linking a styles.css file. 
I then decided to continuosly add on as I progressed through the Thinkful prep course. 

The current state of this project is my first web page from scratch. 

This webpage will display information about one of my favorite bands, VOLA.
